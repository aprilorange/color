# f

the f part of a website, got it? 

sometimes you do not need MVC/MVVM

sometimes you do feel the name `Angular` sounds weird and looks awful

sometimes you do want to be a vegetarian for a little while

It's been set without Angular by default but can be easily intergrated with whatever MVC framework if you like

---

Here f gives a basic web front-end framework with routings, jQuery and templating.

With gulp's support it'd be easily to build and deploy a simple front-end website.

## Examples

- [Code](http://code.insekai.com) A service like GitHub's Gists
- [ONE](http://one.insekai.com) Web version of HanHan's ONE app
